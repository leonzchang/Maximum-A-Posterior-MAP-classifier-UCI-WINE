### Data Set Information
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

1. Alcohol
2. Malic acid
3. Ash
4. Alcalinity of ash
5. Magnesium
6. Total phenols
7. Flavanoids
8. Nonflavanoid phenols
9. Proanthocyanins
10. Color intensity
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13. Proline

The data was used with many others for comparing various
classifiers. The classes are separable, though only RDA
has achieved 100% correct classification.
(RDA : 100%, QDA 99.4%, LDA 98.9%, 1NN 96.1% (z-transformed data))

Here, the data was used to illustrate the superior performance of
the use of a new appreciation function with RDA.
